Issue: https://telecominfraproject.atlassian.net/browse/WIFI-11388

Problem:
If a configuration was accepted by the GW or Provisioning but is still not valid according to the firmware on teh device,
the device will reject the configuration, however, that configuration is known as the kast good configuration in the GW.
This mens that we will lock the device in a loop where it continuously wants to update the configuration to version X,
and the device will continuously reject it.

Workaround:
Simply send a valid configuration to the GW and this will allow the device you update and stop the cycle.

Fix:
When a new configuration is submitted, store is a "pending". If it is accepted, move it to the current configuration. If
not accepted, simply remove it. One corner case exists. For some configuration updates, the AP will never complete the
update cycle, even if it has updated the configuration. In that case, we can detect the configuration during a connect
later. At that moment, when we look for an upgrade, we must compare with the pending UUID and the current UUID. If it matches the pending,
we know the last update worked. If it does not, we know to revert.
